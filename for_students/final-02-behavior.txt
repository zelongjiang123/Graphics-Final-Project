Three different behaviors that you made:
1. GrFerrisWheel-1* - the rotating ferris wheel
2. CarGeometry2-1* - the cars that are moving, turning, stopping at intersection, park in the parking lot, and then start moving again (like a state machine).
3. PanzerGeometry1-1* - the tank will rotate its terret and fire

At least one object is rideable / followable
1. PanzerGeometry1-1* - you can follow and ride the terret when it rotate
2. Carousel-0* - you can follow one of the horse
3. BalloonGeometry1-1* - the surveillance balloon is rideable, it moves in circular motion in the sky

One behavior that is not simple:
Not simple: PanzerGeometry1-1* - the tank will rotate its terret and fire. The cannon of the tank will eject a shell (bomb)and the shell will travel in a "projectile motion". After the shell hits the ground, it will explode and leave a black hole on the ground

Animated Articulated Figure:
Articulated: Carousel-0* - the horse moves up and down while the entire carousel is spinning

Other Behaviors that you made: (backup in case something above doesn't count)
- CarGeometry2-1* - this behavior is also not simple and it also rideable. The cars that are moving, turning, stopping at intersection, and then start moving again (like a state machine).
- GrDumbo-0* - this behavior is also an animated articulated figure. The dumbo spins while each horse moves up and down.
