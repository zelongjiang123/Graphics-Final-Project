(Required) Two kinds of objects created for this assignment:
1. BasketGeometry1-1* - the basket in basketball court
2. PanzerGeometry1-1* - a panzer 6, a german tank. Yes, I actually made one myself!!!

(Required) Five other kinds of objects that you created (possibly in previous assignments):
3. HouseGeometry1-1* - houses that I made in wb08
4. CarGeometry2-1* - Vehicles that I made in wb08 (its a moving object so you might want to use follow instead of lookat)
5. TreeGeometry1-1* - trees that I made in wb08
6. GoalGeometry1-1* - Soccer goal on the soccer pitch 
7. GrFerrisWheel-1* - amusement park facilities that I made in wb08

(Optional) Backup Objects (more objects that you created, in case the ones above don't count):
- TowerGeometry1-1* - towers that I made in wb08
- SoccerGeometry1-1* - soccer pitch
- StopsignGeometry1-1* - a stop sign
- BalloonGeometry1-1* - a surveillance balloon (its a moving object so you might want to use follow instead of lookat)

At least one of each type of object:
Building/structure: HouseGeometry1-1* (described above), TowerGeometry1-1* (described above) 
Vehicle: CarGeomtry2-1* (described above), PanzerGeometry1-1* (described above)
Natural Element: TreeGeometry1-1* (described above)

Object loaded from a model file:
Model: PlantGeometry-1* - loaded from Alien Plant.obj downloaded from the web, attribution in the attribution.txt

An object with a shader that you wrote:
ShaderObj: GrBulldozer-1* - I used the GrBulldozer I made in wb07 and wrote a simple shader to make a colorful texture
